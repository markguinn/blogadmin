BlogAdmin Module
0.1.0 alpha

TODO:
- create CategoriesWidget
- create Authors widget
- check bug with image fields
- add new author should put it in the correct group
- profile photo upload doesn't work
- author and category filters don't actually seem to work (on frontend)

(would be nice)
- change extension classes to be named better (in a way that's less likely to clash)
- urlsegment on categories should automatically populate (via js so it's more clear)
- published/unpublished - make it clickable
- resizable content area
- better tag editing
	- autocomplete
	- clickable tag cloud
- add/remove widgets from dashboard
- make it look nicer
- clean up author profile edit code
- can we get rid of BlogProfile_Controller

(longer term)
- write tests
- convert behaviour.js stuff to entwine
- convert to modeladmin
- fix SQL to be ansi compliant
- test with postgre and php 5.3
- clean up routing in BlogAdmin

DEBT:
- selection in the left sidebar doesn't update if you click Cancel or Add New Post buttons
- cancel button doesn't go back to the same state - would lose sorting/paging
- if you don't have admin access you can't actually edit/delete anything
- datefield popups in the sidebar cause scrolling instead of appearing on the other side
- most of the links don't work outside of an Ajax context
- comment widgets on dashboard don't respect permissions
- i think the unsaved fields message comes up on the blog list form and shouldn't
